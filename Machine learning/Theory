*Machine learning
it is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans

* how does machine learning work?
machine learning algorithms find natural patterns in data that generates insight and help you make betteer decisions and predictions.

*Building blocks
-independent variables
-dependent variables
-data

*Algorithms and models
*Supervised ml algorithm(labeled data)-sample data set is already given (it is also called hypothesis)
   null hypothesis or 
    -clasification
    -regression
*unsupervised ml algorithm
   -clustering
    
        
Linear Regression (coreleation between data)   
    y=f(y is dependent on x)
    y=mx+c
    y=b0+b1x
