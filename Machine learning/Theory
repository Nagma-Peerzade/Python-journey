*Machine learning
it is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans

* how does machine learning work?
machine learning algorithms find natural patterns in data that generates insight and help you make betteer decisions and predictions.

*Building blocks
-independent variables
-dependent variables
-data

*Algorithms and models
*Supervised ml algorithm(labeled data)-sample data set is already given (it is also called hypothesis)
   null hypothesis or 
    -clasification
    -regression
*unsupervised ml algorithm
   -clustering
    
        
Linear Regression (coreleation between data)   
    y=f(y is dependent on x)
    y=mx+c
    y=b0+b1x

Bayes Therom depends on
*conditional probality
*Independent Event
*Dependent Event


-conditional probability
p(A/B)=P(B/A)*p(A)
       ____________
        P(B)
        
categorical output is yes or no
p(y/(x1,x2....xn))= p(x1/y)*p(x2/y)....*p(xn/y)*p(y)
                    ________________________________
                       p(x1)p(x2)......p(n)

*argmax(fit or unfit)
height=0.60
weight=0.40
bmi=0.25
age=0.15

Naive Bayes Classifier
-it is based on bayes theorm
class variable(prediction or output)
vectors(rows)

Assumption
-independent(no pair of features are dependent) 
-equal(all the features are equally contributing)


before event
-positerior probabilty(p(A/B))
-liklihood probability(p(B/A))
-marginal probability(p(B))
-priori probabilty(p(A))
